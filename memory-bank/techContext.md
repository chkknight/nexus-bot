# Technical Context

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go (chosen for performance and concurrency)
- **Current Setup**: Basic Go module with minimal dependencies
- **Build Tool**: Just (justfile present)

## Current Dependencies
From go.mod analysis:
- Go 1.x (to be confirmed)
- Minimal external dependencies currently

## Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Real-time processing of market data
- **Concurrency**: Handle multiple data streams and calculations
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and error handling
- **Extensibility**: Clean architecture for adding new indicators

## Required Libraries (To Be Added)
- **Market Data**: API clients for data sources
- **Technical Analysis**: Math libraries for indicator calculations
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON config handling
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging
- **Testing**: Unit and integration testing frameworks

## Development Setup
- Go development environment
- Market data API access (to be determined)
- Testing with historical data
- Configuration management

## Technical Constraints
- Real-time processing requirements
- Memory efficiency for large datasets
- Network latency considerations
- API rate limits and reliability

## Architecture Considerations
- Modular design for indicators
- Data pipeline architecture
- Signal aggregation logic
- Configuration and parameter management
